<h1> to do </h1>

1. remove the five rounds logic

2. three buttons for rock, paper and scissors
    - add event listener to the buttons that call playRound() with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked

3. add a div for displaying results, change console.logs into DOM methods.

4. display the score and announce a winner once one player reaches 5 points

6. you WILL have to rewrite ur code!!! its okay
